Title: Evaluation of Machine Learning Regressors: Implementation and Analysis
(Please use this title as title of your assignment)

Objective:  By the end of Lab 2, you should be able to explain the code, interpret histograms and outputs from the used functions, and understand the reasoning behind the operations performed on the data.
In this lab session, you learned how to prepare a dataset for ML algorithms. You also trained and evaluated Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor on the prepared dataset.

Assignment Instructions:

  Based on the practical knowledge gained in Lab 2, run a full pipeline to prepare your data for the Machine Learning model. Ensure that you create a complete pipeline.
  
  Experiment with a Support Vector Machine Regressor (sklearn.svm.SVR) using different ways of evaluating your model. Use the best SVR predictor for your model. (Hint: This assignment is part of one of the exercises in your course book.)
  
  Compare and discuss the results of the SVR regressor with the other three models used in Lab 2 (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression), supporting your analysis with graphs and charts.
